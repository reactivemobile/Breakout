# Breakout
This is a Kotlin-driven engine for a breakout-style game.

The game engine can be embedded in any JVM code and the aim of this project is to have both Android and JavaFx implementations.

Included in the repository is a simple JavaFX UI using the Kotlin engine to drive the game.

To run the demo navigate to the root directory and run 
`./gradlew jfxRun`
